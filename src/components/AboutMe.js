      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <h6>
        I am interested in becoming involved in software development,
        particularly in the context of cloud infrastructure, cybersecurity and
        software engineering (full-stack). Certified in Microsoft Azure
        Fundamentals (AZ-900), and a graduate of Columbia University School of
        Engineering's Full Stack Web Developer Boot Camp.
      </h6>

      <h6>
        I have experience in HTML/CSS Web Development, JavaScript/jQuery,
        NodeJS, Express.js, MySQL, MongoDB, ReactJS and .NET in deploying Azure
        resources and general infrastructure via Azure/MS PowerShell, CLI, and
        the Cloud Shell.
      </h6>

      <h6>
        I implement an immense focus on developing applications with responsive
        designs that illicit pleasant user experiences. It is a firm belief of
        mine that there is nothing more important in the rapidly morphing world
        of tech than the ability for a user to have a genuine interaction, and
        utility, for an application.
